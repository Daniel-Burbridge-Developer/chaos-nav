# Chaos-Nav

Hobby Project, experimenting with transperth!

- [x] Show Markers for bus stops

- [ ] Display any active (live) busses
- [ ] Select bus to get live tracking
- [x] Search for Green Cats, etc
- [ ] Display correct Icon for bus/train/etc

- [ ] Clean Code up.

There was an idea of featured routes - i prefer favorites to auto display

PLAN OF ATTACK.

- [ ] Display Card Information depending on what Card is loaded, call the API route from the card itself
- [ ] Implement Zustand, set bus or stop as "active point of interest" to display on map
- [ ] Do the big page thing, where I have all the busses & their status's listed.
- [ ] Do the same for stops??? (Skippy Skippy?)
- [ ] Display map data again
- [ ] Display surrounding stops
